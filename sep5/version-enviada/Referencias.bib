ABSTRACT = {The emergence of an aging society is inevitable due to the continued increases in life expectancy and decreases in birth rate. These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive methods that can easily measure brain waves alone to predict and monitor stroke diseases in real time during daily life. These findings are expected to lead to significant improvements for early stroke detection with reduced cost and discomfort compared to other measuring techniques.},

abstract = {The rapid development of diagnostic technologies in healthcare is leading to higher requirements for physicians to handle and integrate the heterogeneous, yet complementary data that are produced during routine practice. For instance, the personalized diagnosis and treatment planning for a single cancer patient relies on various images (e.g. radiology, pathology and camera images) and non-image data (e.g. clinical data and genomic data). However, such decision-making procedures can be subjective, qualitative, and have large inter-subject variabilities. With the recent advances in multimodal deep learning technologies, an increasingly large number of efforts have been devoted to a key question: how do we extract and aggregate multimodal information to ultimately provide more objective, quantitative computer-aided clinical decision making? This paper reviews the recent studies on dealing with such a question. Briefly, this review will include the (a) overview of current multimodal learning workflows, (b) summarization of multimodal fusion methods, (c) discussion of the performance, (d) applications in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and (e) challenges and future directions.}

ABSTRACT = {We review in this paper the wearable-based technologies intended for real-time monitoring of stroke-related physiological parameters. These measurements are undertaken to prevent death and disability due to stroke. We compare the various characteristics, such as weight, accessibility, frequency of use, data continuity, and response time of these wearables. It was found that the most user-friendly wearables can have limitations in reporting high-precision prediction outcomes. Therefore, we report also the trend of integrating these wearables into the internet of things (IoT) and combining electronic health records (EHRs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to establish a stroke risk prediction system. Due to different characteristics, such as accessibility, time, and spatial resolution of various wearable-based technologies, strategies of applying different types of wearables to maximize the efficacy of stroke risk prediction are also reported. In addition, based on the various applications of multimodal electroencephalography–functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG–fNIRS) on stroke patients, the perspective of using this technique to improve the prediction performance is elaborated. Expected prediction has to be dynamically delivered with high-precision outcomes. There is a need for stroke risk stratification and management to reduce the resulting social and economic burden.},

abstract = {Summary
Background
The contribution of modifiable risk factors to the increasing global and regional burden of stroke is unclear, but knowledge about this contribution is crucial for informing stroke prevention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) to estimate the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of stroke-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with potentially modifiable environmental, occupational, behavioural, physiological, and metabolic risk factors in different age and sex groups worldwide and in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries, from 1990 to 2013.
Methods
We used data on stroke-related DALYs, risk factors, and PAF from the GBD 2013 Study to estimate the burden of stroke by age and sex (with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals [UI]) in 188 countries, as measured with stroke-related DALYs in 1990 and 2013. We evaluated attributable DALYs for 17 risk factors (air pollution and environmental, dietary, physical activity, tobacco smoke, and physiological) and six clusters of risk factors by use of three inputs: risk factor exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. For most risk factors, we synthesised data for exposure with a Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR) or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. We based relative risks on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks, such as high body-mass index (BMI), through other risks, such as high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and high total cholesterol.
Findings
Globally, 90·5% (95% UI 88·5–92·2) of the stroke burden (as measured in DALYs) was attributable to the modifiable risk factors analysed, including 74·2% (95% UI 70·7–76·7) due to behavioural factors (smoking, poor diet, and low physical activity). Clusters of metabolic factors (high SBP, high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and low glomerular filtration rate; 72·4%, 95% UI 70·2–73·5) and environmental factors (air pollution and lead exposure; 33·4%, 95% UI 32·4–34·3) were the second and third largest contributors to DALYs. Globally, 29·2% (95% UI 28·2–29·6) of the burden of stroke was attributed to air pollution. Although globally there were no significant differences between sexes in the proportion of stroke burden due to behavioural, environmental, and metabolic risk clusters, in the low-income and middle-income countries, the PAF of behavioural risk clusters in males was greater than in females. The PAF of all risk factors increased from 1990 to 2013 (except for second-hand smoking and household air pollution from solid fuels) and varied significantly between countries.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that more than 90% of the stroke burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors, and achieving control of behavioural and metabolic risk factors could avert more than three-quarters of the global stroke burden. Air pollution has emerged as a significant contributor to global stroke burden, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and therefore reducing exposure to air pollution should be one of the main priorities to reduce stroke burden in these countries.

abstract = {Motivation:
Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and disability worldwide, often followed by a long rehabilitation period. To improve and personalize stroke rehabilitation, it is essential to provide a reliable prognosis to caregivers and patients. Deep learning techniques might improve the predictions by incorporating different data modalities. We present a multimodal approach to predict the functional status of acute ischemic stroke patients after their discharge based on tabular data and CT perfusion imaging.
Methods:
We conducted experiments on tabular, imaging, and multimodal deep learning architectures to predict dichotomized mRS scores 3 months after the event. The dataset was collected from a Dutch hospital and includes 98 CVA patients with a visible occlusion on their CT perfusion scan. Tabular data is based on the Dutch Acute Stroke Audit data, and imaging data consists of summed-up CT perfusion maps.
Results:
On the tabular data, TabNet outperformed our baselines with an AUC of 0.71, while ResNet-10 on the imaging data performed comparably with an AUC of 0.70. Our implementation of the multimodal DAFT architecture outperforms baselines as well as comparable studies by achieving an 0.75 AUC, and 0.80 F1 score. This was achieved with a final model of less than a hundred thousand optimizable parameters, and a dataset less than half the size of reference papers.
Conclusion:
Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the functional outcome for ischemic stroke patients and the usability of multimodal deep learning architectures for this purpose.}

ABSTRACT = {Despite therapeutic advancements, stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability. The quality of current stroke prognostic models varies considerably, whereas prediction models of post-stroke disability and mortality are restricted by the sample size, the range of clinical and risk factors and the clinical applicability in general. Accurate prognostication can ease post-stroke discharge planning and help healthcare practitioners individualize aggressive treatment or palliative care, based on projected life expectancy and clinical course. In this study, we aimed to develop an explainable machine learning methodology to predict functional outcomes of stroke patients at discharge, using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) as a binary classification problem. We identified 35 parameters from the admission, the first 72 h, as well as the medical history of stroke patients, and used them to train the model. We divided the patients into two classes in two approaches: “Independent” vs. “Non-Independent” and “Non-Disability” vs. “Disability”. Using various classifiers, we found that the best models in both approaches had an upward trend, with respect to the selected biomarkers, and achieved a maximum accuracy of 88.57% and 89.29%, respectively. The common features in both approaches included: age, hemispheric stroke localization, stroke localization based on blood supply, development of respiratory infection, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission and systolic blood pressure levels upon admission. Intubation and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels upon admission are additional features for the first approach and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) levels upon admission for the second. Our results suggest that the said factors may be important predictors of functional outcomes in stroke patients.},

ABSTRACT={<p>The prevalence of disabled survivors of prematurity has increased dramatically in the past 3 decades. These survivors, especially, very preterm infants (VPIs), born ≤ 32 weeks gestational age, are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Early and clinically effective personalized prediction of outcomes, which forms the basis for early treatment decisions, is urgently needed during the peak neuroplasticity window—the first couple of years after birth—for at-risk infants, when intervention is likely to be most effective. Advances in MRI enable the noninvasive visualization of infants' brains through acquired multimodal images, which are more informative than unimodal MRI data by providing complementary/supplementary depicting of brain tissue characteristics and pathology. Thus, analyzing quantitative multimodal MRI features affords unique opportunities to study early postnatal brain development and neurodevelopmental outcome prediction in VPIs. In this study, we investigated the predictive power of multimodal MRI data, including T2-weighted anatomical MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and clinical data for the prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. We hypothesize that integrating multimodal MRI and clinical data improves the prediction over using each individual data modality. Employing the aforementioned multimodal data, we proposed novel end-to-end deep multimodal models to predict neurodevelopmental (i.e., cognitive, language, and motor) deficits independently at 2 years corrected age. We found that the proposed models can predict cognitive, language, and motor deficits at 2 years corrected age with an accuracy of 88.4, 87.2, and 86.7%, respectively, significantly better than using individual data modalities. This current study can be considered as proof-of-concept. A larger study with external validation is important to validate our approach to further assess its clinical utility and overall generalizability.</p>}}

ABSTRACT = {Stroke is a leading cause of disabilities in adults and the elderly which can result in numerous social or economic difficulties. If left untreated, stroke can lead to death. In most cases, patients with stroke have been observed to have abnormal bio-signals (i.e., ECG). Therefore, if individuals are monitored and have their bio-signals measured and accurately assessed in real-time, they can receive appropriate treatment quickly. However, most diagnosis and prediction systems for stroke are image analysis tools such as CT or MRI, which are expensive and difficult to use for real-time diagnosis. In this paper, we developed a stroke prediction system that detects stroke using real-time bio-signals with artificial intelligence (AI). Both machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithms were used in our system. EMG (Electromyography) bio-signals were collected in real time from thighs and calves, after which the important features were extracted, and prediction models were developed based on everyday activities. Prediction accuracies of 90.38% for Random Forest and of 98.958% for LSTM were obtained for our proposed system. This system can be considered an alternative, low-cost, real-time diagnosis system that can obtain accurate stroke prediction and can potentially be used for other diseases such as heart disease.},

abstract = {Objective
Computer-assisted diagnostic and prognostic systems of the future should be capable of simultaneously processing multimodal data. Multimodal deep learning (MDL), which involves the integration of multiple sources of data, such as images and text, has the potential to revolutionize the analysis and interpretation of biomedical data. However, it only caught researchers’ attention recently. To this end, there is a critical need to conduct a systematic review on this topic, identify the limitations of current work, and explore future directions.
Methods
In this scoping review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and identify key concepts, types of studies, and research gaps with a focus on biomedical images and texts joint learning, mainly because these two were the most commonly available data types in MDL research.
Result
This study reviewed the current uses of multimodal deep learning on five tasks: (1) Report generation, (2) Visual question answering, (3) Cross-modal retrieval, (4) Computer-aided diagnosis, and (5) Semantic segmentation.
Conclusion
Our results highlight the diverse applications and potential of MDL and suggest directions for future research in the field. We hope our review will facilitate the collaboration of natural language processing (NLP) and medical imaging communities and support the next generation of decision-making and computer-assisted diagnostic system development.}

abstract="A stroke occurs when an artery in the brain ruptures and bleeds or when the blood supply to the brain is cut off. Blood and oxygen cannot reach the brain's tissues due to the rupture or obstruction resulting in tissue death. The Middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the largest cerebral artery and the most commonly damaged vessel in stroke. The quick onset of a focused neurological deficit caused by interruption of blood flow in the territory supplied by the MCA is known as an MCA stroke. Alberta stroke programme early CT score (ASPECTS) is used to estimate the extent of early ischemic changes in patients with MCA stroke. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to score the CT scan for ASPECTS. Our work has three highlights. First, we propose a novel method for medical image segmentation for stroke detection. Second, we show the effectiveness of AI solution for fully-automated ASPECT scoring with reduced diagnosis time for a given non-contrast CT (NCCT) Scan. Our algorithms show a dice similarity coefficient of 0.64 for the MCA anatomy segmentation and 0.72 for the infarcts segmentation. Lastly, we show that our model's performance is inline with inter-reader variability between radiologists.",
