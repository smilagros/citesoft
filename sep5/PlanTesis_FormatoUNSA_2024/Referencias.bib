   abstract = {During the last decades, the volume of multimedia content posted in social networks has grown exponentially and such information is immediately propagated and consumed by a significant number of users. In this scenario, the disruption of fake news providers and bot accounts for spreading propaganda information as well as sensitive content throughout the network has fostered applied researh to automatically measure the reliability of social networks accounts via Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present a multilingual approach for addressing the bot identification task in Twitter via Deep learning (DL) approaches to support end-users when checking the credibility of a certain Twitter account. To do so, several experiments were conducted using state-of-the-art Multilingual Language Models to generate an encoding of the text-based features of the user account that are later on concatenated with the rest of the metadata to build a potential input vector on top of a Dense Network denoted as Bot-DenseNet. Consequently, this paper assesses the language constraint from previous studies where the encoding of the user account only considered either the metadatainformation or the metadata information together with some basic semantic text features. Moreover, the Bot-DenseNet produces a low-dimensional representation of the user account which can be used for any application within the Information Retrieval (IR) framework.},

@article{Orabi2020,
   abstract = {Social media bots (automated accounts) attacks are organized crimes that pose potential threats to public opinion, democracy, public health, stock market and other disciplines. While researchers are building many models to detect social media bot accounts, attackers, on the other hand, evolve their bots to evade detection. This everlasting cat and mouse game makes this field vibrant and demands continuous development. To guide and enhance future solutions, this work provides an overview of social media bots attacks, current detection methods and challenges in this area. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review based on a predefined search strategy, which includes literature concerned about social media bots detection methods, published between 2010 and 2019. The results of this review include a refined taxonomy of detection methods, a highlight of the techniques used to detect bots in social media and a comparison between current detection methods. Some of the gaps identified by this work are: the literature mostly focus on Twitter platform only and rarely use methods other than supervised machine learning, most of the public datasets are not accurate or large enough, integrated systems and real-time detection are required, and efforts to spread awareness are needed to arm legitimate users with knowledge.},

   abstract = {This book offers a highly accessible introduction to natural language processing, the field that supports a variety of language technologies, from predictive text and email filtering to automatic summarization and translation. With it, you'll learn how to write Python programs that work with large collections of unstructured text. You'll access richly annotated datasets using a comprehensive range of linguistic data structures, and you'll understand the main algorithms for analyzing the content and structure of written communication. Packed with examples and exercises, Natural Language Processing with Python will help you:Extract information from unstructured text, either to guess the topic or identify "named entities" Analyze linguistic structure in text, including parsing and semantic analysis Access popular linguistic databases, including WordNet and treebanks Integrate techniques drawn from fields as diverse as linguistics and artificial intelligence This book will help you gain practical skills in natural language processing using the Python programming language and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) open source library. If you're interested in developing web applications, analyzing multilingual news sources, or documenting endangered languages - or if you're simply curious to have a programmer's perspective on how human language works - you'll find Natural Language Processing with Python both fascinating and immensely useful.},

@article{Mao2022,
   abstract = {Nowadays, online social networks (OSNs) support users in sharing their information and providing valuable data for various applications, e.g., rating and recommendation systems, search engine systems, etc. In such online social network-based applications, information quality is essential. However, the easy-to-use interactive user interfaces and free publication mechanisms facilitate malicious users to launch Sybil Attacks. They create fake identities, pollute user-generated content, and cause server information quality problems, such as buzz, rumor, spam, etc. Most existing graph-based sybil detection approaches only consider the static graph structure features and heavily rely on the prior knowledge of labeled nodes. “Limited-attack-edge” assumption, the critical assumption of these approaches has been proved invalid in many scenarios. In this paper, we propose SybilHunter, a hybrid graph-based sybil detection approach by aggregating user social behavior patterns. Our approach refines the OSN structure, quantifies nodes’ similarity according to the dynamic user behavior features to evaluate user pairs’ trustworthiness and consistency. Then it constructs a weighted-strong-social (WSS) graph, based on which SybilHunter outputs sybil nodes. We simulate and evaluate our approach under a Weibo dataset. The AUC of SybilHunter achieves 0.945, which is significantly higher than typical graph-based sybil detection methods, such as SybilRank, SybilWalk, etc.},
